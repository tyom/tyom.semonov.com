    I worked in a team responsible for research and development of features
    used by online marketplaces around the world for various platforms. Such as
    suggestions by similarity or personal relevance.

    I was hired as a sole frontend developer in the team to build a web SDK which
    used backend services developed by the rest of the group. It needed to
    provide a customisable UI for the marketplaces to use on their sites.
    I evaluated several options and advised on using Preact for UI layer while
    separating the core business logic to a separate package. The SDK contained
    several packages: core, UI and Web Components.

    The SDK, being technology-agnostic, was designed to be used with any stack
    and distributed in several ways: via a package manager and scripts stored
    in an S3 bucket (CDN). The SDK was extensively documented to help other
    developers to include it to their sites.

    Challenges included: browser support (IE11+), file sizes, styling and
    customisation.
