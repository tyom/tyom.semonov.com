    I worked in a team responsible for research and development of features
    used by online marketplaces around the world for various platforms. Such as
    suggestions by similarity or personal relevance.

    Hired as a sole frontend developer in the team to build a web SDK which
    used backend services developed by the rest of the group. It needed to
    provide a customisable UI for the global marketplaces. Following evaluation,
    the recommendation was to use small Preact library for UI layer. The core
    business logic available for low level customiations. The SDK contained
    several packages: core, UI and Web Components.

    Tech-agnostic SDK was designed to be used with any stack and distributed in
    several ways: via a package manager and scripts stored in an S3 bucket (CDN).
    The SDK was extensively tested and documented to help with implementation
    and contributions.
